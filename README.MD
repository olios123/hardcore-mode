# Hardcore Mode

Are you ready to raise the stakes on your Minecraft server? **HardcoreMode** is not just another plugin — it completely transforms the way players **experience death**. Instead of respawning like nothing happened, players are **temporarily or permanently banned when they die**.

This isn't a punishment — it's a **feature**. A **challenge**. A new way to keep your server fresh, exciting, and truly hardcore.


## Features

When a player dies:
- They are banned from the server for a configurable amount of time.
- The ban duration can scale based on how many times they've died before.
- Players with higher ranks can receive customized ban lengths.
- Ban penalties can decay over time if a player survives long enough.

For Admins:
- Set default lives for all players
- Adjust ban time by death count or permission rank
- Show or hide lives info in nicknames like `☠ 3 Deaths` or `❤️ 1 Life`
- Enable ban level reductions over time
- Customize death effects (lightning, sounds, messages)

---

Compatible with the [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) plugin with included over 30 placeholders.

- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇵🇱 Polish
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇮🇹 Italian
